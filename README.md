# Vehicle Detection
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)


The goal of this project was to write a software pipeline to detect vehicles in a video (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4).

The Project
---

The code and whole write up (with images) is available in the jupyter notebook [vehicle detection.ipynb](vehicle%20detection.ipynb)


The Data
---

Here are links to the labeled data for [vehicle](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/Vehicle_Tracking/vehicles.zip) and [non-vehicle](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/Vehicle_Tracking/non-vehicles.zip) examples to train your classifier.  These example images come from a combination of the [GTI vehicle image database](http://www.gti.ssr.upm.es/data/Vehicle_database.html), the [KITTI vision benchmark suite](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/), and examples extracted from the project video itself.   You are welcome and encouraged to take advantage of the recently released [Udacity labeled dataset](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car/tree/master/annotations) to augment your training data.

Some example images for testing your pipeline on single frames are located in the `test_images` folder.  To help the reviewer examine your work, please save examples of the output from each stage of your pipeline in the folder called `ouput_images`, and include them in your writeup for the project by describing what each image shows. The video called `project_video.mp4` is the video your pipeline should work well on.
